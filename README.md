# Priceless

## Inspiration

This app was inspired by Craigslist, Amazon, and Trash Nothing. We wanted to blend the best aspects of each to create a marketplace where users can give away their used items. We also added a resources page that allows one to find some common organizations that accepts items for donation if you are unable to find a person in your area that wants the item you have listed.
