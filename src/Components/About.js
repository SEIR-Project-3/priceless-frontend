				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					Priceless is an app created out of necessity. Many of us have items
					that we don't use and need to get rid of. In society we create
					unnecessary amounts of trash by throwing away items that could be
					given a second life if put into the hands of another person. Priceless
					seeks to connect like-minded individuals with the idea that they can
					find a new home for items that can be used by others. We operate with
					off of the belief that truly, "one person's trash is another person's
					treasure." We also understand that it may be difficult to find a a
					suitor for our items so we have created a list of resources that can
					assist in helping to recycle usable but unwanted items. The cost it
					takes to recycle is free!
